= err_merchant

This is a very simple Rails Engine for replacing the standard (ugly) Rails exception pages with pages which are rendered in your layout.

== Installation
Add the gem to your Gemfile, run `bundle install` and restart your server:

  gem 'err_merchant'

This is it. If you want to check the error pages in development mode, make sure to set +config.consider_all_requests_local+ to +false+ and restart your development server.

=== Should I keep the standard Rails error pages around?
Yes, these files are used as a fallback if +err_merchant+ itself raises an exception. This can happen if there is an error in your application layout.

== Configuration
* +ErrMerchant.layout+: Can be used to set the layout for the error pages. By default the application-layout is used.
* +ErrMerchant.skip_filters+: Can be used to skip certain filters when rendering errors. Most common are filters by authorization gems like `cancan` or `pundit` which ensure that authorization happens. These have to be skipped when rendering error pages. (example: `ErrMerchant.skip_filters[:after] = [:verify_authorized]` for pundit)

== I18n
You can translate the error messages, by default they are the same as the standard Rails errors:

  err_merchant:
    '404':
      title: "The page you were looking for doesn't exist."
      description: "You may have mistyped the address or the page may have moved."
    '422':
      title: "The change you wanted was rejected."
      description: "Maybe you tried to change something you didn't have access to."
    '500':
      title: "We're sorry, but something went wrong."
      description: "We've been notified about this issue and we'll take a look at it shortly."

Please note that there are translations missing in development mode if you don't supply translations for your locale. In production however, +config.i18n.fallbacks+ is usually set to +true+, so the error messages for the default locale will be shown if the lookup is not successful.
