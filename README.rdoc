= err_merchant
This is a very simple Rails Engine for replacing the standard (ugly) Rails exception pages, with pages which are rendered in your layout. There are several gems out there that do the same, but this one takes the approach proposed by AccUser[http://accuser.cc/posts/1-rails-3-0-exception-handling]. I just made a gem out of it because I use it in every project.

== Installation
Add the gem to your Gemfile, run `bundle install` and restart your server:

  gem 'err_merchant'

This is it. If you want to check the error pages in development mode, make sure to set +config.consider_all_requests_local+ to +false+ and restart your development server.

== I18n
You can translate the error messages, by default they are the same as the standard Rails errors:

  err_merchant:
    '404':
      title: "The page you were looking for doesn't exist."
      description: "You may have mistyped the address or the page may have moved."
    '422':
      title: "The change you wanted was rejected."
      description: "Maybe you tried to change something you didn't have access to."
    '500':
      title: "We're sorry, but something went wrong."
      description: "We've been notified about this issue and we'll take a look at it shortly."

Please note that there are translations missing in development mode if you don't supply translations for your locale. In production however, +config.i18n.fallbacks+ is usually set to +true+, so the english error message will be shown if the lookup is unsuccessful.
